@article{brokenwire,
   abstract = {We present a novel attack against the Combined Charging System, one of the most widely used DC rapid charging systems for electric vehicles (EVs). Our attack, Brokenwire, interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack can be conducted wirelessly from a distance, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted stealthily and simultaneously. In addition, it can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 & ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. We first study the attack in a controlled testbed and then demonstrate it against seven vehicles and 18 chargers in real deployments. We find the attack to be successful in the real world, at ranges up to 47 m, for a power budget of less than 1 W. We further show that the attack can work between the floors of a building (e.g., multi-story parking), through perimeter fences, and from 'drive-by' attacks. We present a heuristic model to estimate the number of vehicles that can be attacked simultaneously for a given output power. Brokenwire has immediate implications for many of the around 12 million battery EVs on the roads worldwide - and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and crucial public services. As such, we conducted a disclosure to the industry and discussed a range of mitigation techniques that could be deployed to limit the impact.},

Concept of LIN frames and identifiers has its roots in CAN-bus however data bytes are serialized in asynchronous serial communication format usual for UARTs. The article focuses on LIN-bus support implementation and integration into Linux based systems with attempt to offer portable solution with minimal hardware dependencies. This is possible thanks to the compatibility of common UART hardware with LIN-bus serial format. The developed slLIN protocol driver is implemented as a Linux TTY line discipline and uses only common Linux UART serial line discipline API. The solution does not require to implement specialized driver for each architecture or serial interface hardware and is highly portable. The interface from application to slLIN is based on CAN protocol family network API (same as SocketCAN uses). This approach was chosen because LIN-bus is usually found together with CAN-bus infrastructure in applications. The portability of the implementation has been tested on common PC serial port and MPC5200 hardware against third party fully-functional LIN device. A utility for frame sequences configuration is also part of the implementation.},

Container-based virtualization and hypervisor-based virtualization are two main types of virtualization technologies that have emerged to the market. Of these two classes, container-based virtualization is able to provide a more lightweight and efficient virtual environment, but not without security concerns. In this paper, we analyze the security level of Docker, a well-known representative of container-based approaches. The analysis considers two areas: (1) the internal security of Docker, and (2) how Docker interacts with the security features of the Linux kernel, such as SELinux and AppArmor, in order to harden the host system. Furthermore, the paper also discusses and identifies what could be done when using Docker to increase its level of security.},

@article{relayattack,
   abstract = {To support the increasing spread of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Charging Stations (CSs) are being installed worldwide. The new generation of CSs employs the Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) paradigm by implementing novel standards such as the ISO 15118. This standard enables high-level communication between the vehicle and the charging column, helps manage the charge smartly, and simplifies the payment phase. This novel charging paradigm, which connects the Smart Grid to external networks (e.g., EVs and CSs), has not been thoroughly examined yet. Therefore, it may lead to dangerous vulnerability surfaces and new research challenges. In this paper, we present EVExchange, the first attack to steal energy during a charging session in a V2G communication: i.e., charging the attacker's car while letting the victim pay for it. Furthermore, if reverse charging flow is enabled, the attacker can even sell the energy available on the victim's car! Thus, getting the economic profit of this selling, and leaving the victim with a completely discharged battery. We developed a virtual and a physical testbed in which we validate the attack and prove its effectiveness in stealing the energy. To prevent the attack, we propose a lightweight modification of the ISO 15118 protocol to include a distance bounding algorithm. Finally, we validated the countermeasure on our testbeds. Our results show that the proposed countermeasure can identify all the relay attack attempts while being transparent to the user.},

   abstract = {<p>Internet Protocols are utilized to empower the communication between the computing devices in the computer networks. IPv6 offers additional address space and more noteworthy security than IPv4. The progress from IPv4 to IPv6 has been finished through three primary change systems: dual-stack, tunneling, and translation. The IPv6 progress relies upon the similarity with the enormous introduced base of IPv4 nodes and routers just as keeping up with the security of the network from possible threats and vulnerabilities of both Internet protocols. This research identifies potential security issues in the transition mechanisms and proposing prevention mechanisms to the problems identified. Dual-Stack &amp; Tunneling mechanisms were completely implemented in this research work and the security test was based on dual-stack network. A simulation has been designed by using GNS3 and the penetration test by the THC-IPv6 toolkit. After the implementation of simulation, IPv6 in the dual-stack mechanism was identified as vulnerable to DoS via RA flooding and IPv6 fragmentation attacks that shown the IPv6 security problems. Therefore, IPv6 ACLs and RA guards were proposed in order to protect from flooding attacks and VFR should be configured to prevent IPv6 fragmentation.</p>},

   abstract = {Since vehicles became connected to a bus called CAN (Con-troller Area Network), many "garage" hackers got interested in investigating the different controllers, known as ECUs (Engine Control Units), and accessible via the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port. Among those different controllers, some of them are accessible via Wi-Fi, others via GPRS, 3G and 4G mobile networks, that could be attacked during a radio interception attack [19]. Moreover, another little-known vector of attack will appear with the deployment of V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) systems that communicate via power lines support. Nevertheless, no public tool exists to interface with these systems, but also to analyse and to inject V2G traffic. That is why we have developed a tool called V2G Injector to attack these systems. In this article, we will briefly introduce the V2G concept and its similarities with domestic Power-Line Communication systems. Then, we will present the techniques we use in our tool that aim to interface with the system, monitor and inject traffic. We will also present a new specification vulnerability in the communication medium we have been able to exploit to intrude the V2G network. To finish, we will talk about issues we have found during our tests on real equipment, and mitigations we can encounter, or apply, in some contexts as well as possible bypasses.},

   abstract = {Diagnostic over Internet Protocol (DoIP) and Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) are protocols used for diagnostic communications on in-vehicle Ethernet networks. These protocols effectively update large-scale vehicle software installed in Electronic Controller Units (ECUs) on in-vehicle networks. However, these protocols enable attackers to overwrite vehicle software with illegal software or take control of vehicles. Accordingly, attacks against DoIP and UDS have been evaluated. However, these studies have not evaluated attacks against UDS on DoIP. Besides, these studies have not assumed an attacker who can exploit DoIP-based communications to/from a tester. Thus, we analyze and evaluate attacks against UDS on DoIP by an attacker who can exploit DoIP-based communications to/from a tester. Our analysis reveals three attacks: an authentication avoidance attack and two types of man-in-the-middle based session hijacking. Moreover, our evaluation shows that these attacks can be demonstrated on a simulated in-vehicle network. We also propose countermeasures against these attacks.},

Based on a set of selected use-cases, identified by the AUTOSAR partners, the challenges and the approach to master requirements for next generation cars are described. The new platform aims to support dynamic deployment of customer appli-cations, to provide an environment for applications that require high-end computing power and to connect deeply embedded and non-AUTOSAR systems in a smooth way while preserving typical features originated in deeply embedded systems like safety, determinism and real-time capabilities.

Many of these IoT devices collect data including Personal Identifiable Information such as names, phone numbers, and addresses and thus IoT security is important. However, conducting security analysis on IoT devices is challenging due to the variety, the volume of the devices, and the special skills required for hardware and software analysis. In this research, we create and demonstrate a dynamic analysis security testing infrastructure for capturing network traffic from IoT devices. The network traffic is automatically mirrored to a server for live traffic monitoring and offline data analysis. Using the dynamic analysis security testing infrastructure, we conduct extensive security analysis on network traffic from Google Home and Amazon Echo. Our testing results indicate that Google Home enforces tighter security controls than Amazon Echo while both Google and Amazon devices provide the desired security level to protect user data in general. The dynamic analysis security testing infrastructure presented in the paper can be utilized to conduct similar security analysis on any IoT devices.},

   abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) have become a well-known practice in DevOps to ensure fast delivery of new features. This is achieved by automatically testing and releasing new software versions, e.g. multiple times per day. However, classical security management techniques cannot keep up with this quick Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Nonetheless, guaranteeing high security quality of software systems has become increasingly important. The new trend of DevSecOps aims to integrate security techniques into existing DevOps practices. Especially, the automation of security testing is an important area of research in this trend. Although plenty of literature discusses security testing and CI/CD practices, only a few deal with both topics together. Additionally, most of the existing works cover only static code analysis and neglect dynamic testing methods. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate three automated dynamic testing techniques into a CI/CD pipeline and provide an empirical analysis of the introduced overhead. We then go on to identify unique research/technology challenges the DevSecOps communities will face and propose preliminary solutions to these challenges. Our findings will enable informed decisions when employing DevSecOps practices in agile enterprise applications engineering processes and enterprise security.},

   abstract = {The growing digitalisation of our economies and societies is driving the need for increased connectivity of critical applications and infrastructures to the point where failures can lead to important disruptions and consequences to our lives. One growing source of failures for critical applications and infrastructures originates from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in attacks. One approach to mitigating these risks is verifying that critical applications and infrastructures are sufficiently protected by certification of products and services. However, reaching sufficient assurance levels for product certification may require detailed evaluation of product properties. An important challenge for product certification is dealing with product evolution: now that critical applications and infrastructures are connected they are being updated on a more frequent basis. To ensure continuity of certification, updates must be analysed to verify the impact on certified cybersecurity properties. Impacted properties need to be re-certified. This paper proposes a lightweight and flexible incremental certification process that can be integrated with DevSecOps practices to automate as much as possible evidence gathering and certification activities. The approach is illustrated on the Common Criteria product certification scheme and a firewall update on an automotive case study. Only the impact analysis phase of the incremental certification process is illustrated.},

   abstract = {Security by Design becomes a significant aspect for establishing the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. In this paper, we present an approach to utilize virtual prototypes (VP) at system level to enable security evaluation along the design process. The proposed VP-based penetration testing framework provides an approach for attack surface and attack behavior modeling. By utilizing a modular, reconfigurable system simulation, an attack scenario can be assessed with different system alternatives. As the VP simulates both hardware (HW) and software (SW) of a single IoT-device as well as the interconnections of different devices a comprehensive system analysis can be executed. Our framework is based on a model-driven approach, which underlines the achieved degree of automation and its potential for industrial application. A comprehensive system analysis tool is the enabler to apply penetration testing, for identifying weak points in the system design and implementation, from early stages in the design flow. The overall approach is demonstrated by an automotive use case derived from real-world security flaws.},

   abstract = {The impact of global warming and the imperative to limit climate change have stimulated the need to develop new solutions based on renewable energy sources. One of the emerging trends in this endeavor are the Electric Vehicles (EVs), which use electricity instead of traditional fossil fuels as a power source, relying on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm. The novelty of such a paradigm requires careful analysis to avoid malicious attempts. An attacker can exploit several surfaces, such as the remote connection between the Distribution Grid and Charging Supply or the authentication system between the charging Supply Equipment and the Electric Vehicles. However, V2G architecture's high cost and complexity in implementation can restrain this field's research capability. In this paper, we approach this limitation by proposing MiniV2G, an open-source emulator to simulate Electric Vehicle Charging (EVC) built on top of Mininet and RiseV2G. MiniV2G is particularly suitable for security researchers to study and test real V2G charging scenarios. MiniV2G can reproduce with high fidelity a V2G architecture to easily simulate an EV charging process. Finally, we present a MiniV2G application and show how MiniV2G can be used to study V2G communication and develop attacks and countermeasures that can be applied to real systems. Since we believe our tool can be of great help for research in this field, we also made it freely available.},

   abstract = {With the development of advanced driving assistance systems, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted within a car has increased tremendously. Traditional communication bus based systems are unable to meet today’s requirements; hence automotive Ethernet is being developed and standardized. Ethernet has for many years been the de facto standard in interconnecting computers. In that time several vulnerabilities of the networking protocol stack implementations and even the protocols themselves have been discovered. The knowledge from exploiting computer networks can be applied to the automotive domain. Additionally, vehicle manufacturers tend to implement their own stacks, due to copyleft reasons; hence the chances of implementation faults increases as opposed to using well-tested open source solutions. Since the line between security and safety in cars is almost nonexistent, security has to be properly addressed. This thesis investigates the security of automotive Ethernet and its accompanying protocols. It starts with an introduction to computer and automotive networking and protocols. After a solid foundation is laid, it investigates what makes up automotive Ethernet, its application in the field, and the automotive specific components relying on it. After looking at related work, a data network security audit and analysis as defined by the open-source security testing methodology is performed. The system is graded with risk assessment values. Weak points are identified and improvements suggested. The impact of the proposed improvements is shown by reevaluating the system and recalculating the risk assessment values. These efforts further the ultimate goal of achieving increased safety of all traffic participants. },

   abstract = {This paper discusses novel communication network topologies and components and describes an evolutionary path of bringing Ethernet into automotive applications with focus on electric mobility. For next generation in-vehicle networking, the automotive industry identified Ethernet as a promising candidate besides CAN and FlexRay. Ethernet is an IEEE standard and is broadly used in consumer and industry domains. It will bring a number of changes for the design and management of in-vehicle networks and provides significant re-use of components, software, and tools. Ethernet is intended to connect inside the vehicle high-speed communication requiring sub-systems like Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS), navigation and positioning, multimedia, and connectivity systems. For hybrid (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs), Ethernet will be a powerful part of the communication architecture layer that enables the link between the vehicle electronics and the Internet where the vehicle is a part of a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application. Using Ethernet for vehicle connectivity will effectively manage the huge amount of data to be transferred between the outside world and the vehicle through vehicle-to-x (V2V and V2I or V2I+I) communication systems and cloud-based services for advanced energy management solutions. Ethernet is an enabling technology for introducing advanced features into the automotive domain and needs further optimizations in terms of scalability, cost, power, and electrical robustness in order to be adopted and widely used by the industry. © 2013 EDAA.},
